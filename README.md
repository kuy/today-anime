**I can't keep in mind a day of the week of my favorite animes' broadcast ðŸ˜‡**

## Usage

### Installation

Download a latest binary from [Releases](https://github.com/kuy/today-anime/releases) page and extract it anywhere you want.
I recommend you to put the binary at a directory which is already in PATH env.

This application requires [Annict's Personal Access Token](https://annict.jp/settings/apps) to get your programs that is watching now.

To provide the access token to the application, put `.today-anime.json` file to your home directory. Here is an example of the configuration file.
